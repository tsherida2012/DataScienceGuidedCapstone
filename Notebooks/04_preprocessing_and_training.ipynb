    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "You could keep going, trying different values of k, training a model, measuring performance on the test set, and then picking the model with the best test set performance. There's a fundamental problem with this approach: _you're tuning the model to the arbitrary test set_! If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way around this is a technique called _cross-validation_. You partition the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training. This procedure then cycles through k times with a different fold held back each time. Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "#Q: 1 Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "#Answer: First, we established a baseline and went through modeling techniques. We needed a baseline for performance. This was achieved by utilizing simple statistical metrics such as Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared. The baseline model was constructed using the average ticket price. While this approach provided a fundamental understanding of the data, it exhibited signs of overfitting when evaluated against different parameters. It was a reference point for further modeling. Preprocessing included imputing data such as mean or median. The data was also scaled before plugging it into a model. The next model used was the linear regression model. The focus here was to identify key features that significantly influenced ticket prices. The performance of the linear model was evaluated through cross-validation techniques, which suggested that the model was capable of explaining a significant portion of the variance in ticket prices. The choice of features was guided by the linear regression cross-validation analysis, which indicated that the optimal number of parameters is 8. This was observed through an initial rapid increase in performance with increasing features of 8 followed by a plateau on the graph. The consistency of the linear model's performance on the test split with its cross-validation estimate further validated its reliability. Then the random forest regressor was used. The model's performance was assessed through cross-validation, and showcased a lower mean absolute error by almost $1 compared to the linear regression, indicating a more precise and consistent prediction capability. This improvement was not only significant in terms of the reduction in error but also in the model's ability to exhibit less variability, a crucial factor in predicting prices accurately. The MAE mean of 9.84976744990519 with a standard deviation of 1.3837796305517425 underscored the model's robustness. Importantly, the performance of the random forest model on the test set was consistent with the cross-validation results, reinforcing its ability to generalize well to new, unseen data without overfitting. the random forest regressor was chosen for the next stage of modeling. However, I did have to Reduce the number of estimators and narrow the range to get around intensive computation stalling my computer. This decision to use random forest was rooted in the model's ability to balance accuracy and generalizability. The random forest regressor not only provided a lower error margin but also exhibited less variability and a strong capacity to generalize.   The final features to use are vertical_drop, Snow Making, total_chairs, fastQuads, and Runs. Which were picked from the importance provided by the random forest. \n"
